\section{How can we easily recognize when a system of linear equations is inconsistent or not?}
According to the definition of RCLS, we can recognize by looking at (n+1) is a pivot column or not.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Suppose we have converted the augmented matrix of a system of equations into reduced row-echelon form. How do we then identify the dependent and independent (free) variables?}
Pivot columns are dependent variables, while independent variables are not.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{What are the possible solution sets for a system of linear equations?}
There are three solutions: no solution, a unique solution and infinitely many solutions.
The number of solutions depends on the value,

\[
n - r > 0
\]

where \(n\) is a number of variables and nonzero rows \(r\).
