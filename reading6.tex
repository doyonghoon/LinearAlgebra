Nonsingular Matrices
\end{center}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{In your own words state the definition of a nonsingular matrix.}
Nonsingular matrix a square matrix that has trivial solution. Also identity matrix is always a nonsingular matrix.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{What is the easiest way to recognize if a square matrix is nonsingular or not?}
We can recognize the singularity of a square matrix by looking at its trivial solution.
We have a nonsingular matrix if the square matrix has a trivial solution,
otherwise the square matrix is a singular matrix.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Suppose we have a system of equations and its coefficient matrix is nonsingular. What can you say about the solution set for this system?}
The solution for the system of equations must be a unique solution,
and the solution for its coefficient matrix is a trivial solution
since the matrix is an identity matrix.
